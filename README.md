# ROS 2 Integration for Franka Robotics Research Robots

[![CI](https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros2/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository contains the full ROS 2 workspace setup to interface with the **Franka Emika Research 3 robotic arm** for **teleoperation**. This setup is designed to work with ROS 2 and leverages the **Franka Control Interface (FCI)** for real-time control.

Another component of this integration is the use of the **SenseOne 6-axis force-torque sensor from Botasys**, mounted at the end effector of the robotic arm. The sensor data is utilized to enable haptic feedback teleoperation modes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Franka Research 3 robotic arm
- Ubuntu 22.04, Real time kernel
- Docker

---
## Franka Research 3

Please make sure everything is set up correctly, you followed the Real time kernel configuration, the FCI, the minimun requirements for 1kHz, If working with docker, have all the permisions and cpu acces. And to configure adequatly the cpu to performance [CPU Scaling](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/troubleshooting.html#disabling-cpu-frequency-scaling)
also, when building the workspace in ros2, take into account that it must be done with Â´Â´Â´ colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release Â´Â´Â´ and that some packages must be built before others due to requirements and dependencies. so first franka_msg, franka_hardware, franka_semantic_components. then Â´Â´Â´ source install/setup.bashÂ´Â´Â´ and the build the rest of the packages

---

## Running the System

### Launch Franka Robot with Teleoperation

```bash
ros2 launch robot_launch bringup_teleop.launch.py
```

This launch file will:

- Connect to the Franka robot via FCI
- Start the teleoperation control node
- Launch the SenseOne FT sensor node for data publishing
- Optionally visualize the robot in RViz2

---

## SenseOne Force-Torque Sensor

The SenseOne sensor is mounted at the end effector and is used to capture real-time force and torque data. This data is published as a standard `geometry_msgs/WrenchStamped` message and is integrated into the control loop to enable: haptic feedback applications

---

## Teleoperation Capabilities

Teleoperation can be achieved using supported input devices such as:

- Meta Quest 2
- Keyboard (limited functionality)

The control node maps device inputs to Cartesian commands.

---

## Example Applications

- Remote manipulation with real-time force feedback
- Human-in-the-loop control experiments
- Assistive robotic tasks with compliant behaviors
- Research in haptic feedback and shared control
